# AudioPauseDetect
Detect silence sections in speech audio

STEP 1

Work done so far with the initial version:

The python program processes the .wav audio file and generates a list of silent ranges in the audio file.
The printed numbers are start and end of silence ranges.

The output for the reference file is as follows:

12
0.0 1.371

2.704 2.821

3.604 3.751

4.792 5.087

6.893 7.524

7.62 7.805

7.96 8.266

8.442 8.616

9.528 9.834

11.04 11.737

11.864 12.139

14.911 15.023
